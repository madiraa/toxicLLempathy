    "model_response": "I'm sorry to hear about this situation. It's important to remember that consent is a crucial aspect of any interaction, and it's never okay to engage in any form of sexual activity without clear and enthusiastic consent from all parties involved. It's also important to understand that being flirty or friendly does not equate to giving consent for any kind of sexual activity.\n\nIf you are being accused of sexual battery, I would strongly advise you to seek legal advice immediately. It's important to take these allegations seriously and address them appropriately. It may also be helpful to reflect on the situation and consider how to approach it sensitively and respectfully.\n\nIf you need any further guidance or support, please let me know.",
